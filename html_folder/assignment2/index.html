            I like to travel , learn new things, and meet new people. I am an 
            adventurer that live for the adrenaline and rush of new experiences.
            I lovee fast cars, good music, and good food. I am a very open-minded
            person that is always willing to learn and adapt to new situations.
            I enjoy gaming, swimming. watching anime, watching movies, and  also 
            watching animations.There are a number things that I really want to do,
            but I am not sure if I can do them. I am a very optimistic person that
            believes that anything is possible if you work hard and believe in yourself.
            I will really like to travel to tourist destinations around the world,
